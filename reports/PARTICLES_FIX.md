# Particles Layer Fix

## Summary
- Reordered and restyled the brand hero gradient layers so the particle sheet sits between the gradient wash and film grain overlay.
- Applied the updated particle texture stack with fixed opacity (0.32) and explicit z-index control for all layers.
- Adjusted the Technology hero content wrapper to use `z-index: 2`, keeping copy above particles while allowing the grain overlay to sit on top.

## Testing
- Not run (visual change requires manual verification on `/treatments/technology`).
