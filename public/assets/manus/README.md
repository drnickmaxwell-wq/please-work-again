# Manus AI Assets

This directory stores Manus AI export files including ZIP archives, screenshots, and supporting imagery for integration. Place any Manus-provided assets here so they can be served statically from `/assets/manus/` during development.

> These assets are ignored in production builds but remain tracked in Git for collaboration.
